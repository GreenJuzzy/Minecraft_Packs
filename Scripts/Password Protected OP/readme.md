## Password Protected OP

---

This is a script that makes it so the only way you can get op, is by typing in the set password. Leaving de-ops you, and you would have to re-enter the password.
<br>
<br>
You shouldn't mess with it, like adding a "trusted" admins, or making certain people with a tag always get op. This ruins the whole point of this.

*Why?*
<br>
Currently, there is an exploit that takes advantage of an account that has OP on a realm, and pretends to be them. Therefore they have permissions to op others and do other malicious operations.

<br>
Until Mojang has put a patch to this exploit, it's reccomended to use this, or other packs you might find that protects your realm.
